# Multiplayer Toolkit

A toolkit of multiplayer quality-of-life features for **Sid Meier's Civilization
VII**, built on the game's own UI components. Current version: **0.5.2**.

Three tools so far:

- A **Competitive turn timer** — a fourth Turn Timer option in multiplayer setup
  (alongside None / Standard / Dynamic) whose per-turn time scales with cities,
  units, human players and the turn number, with orange/red urgency tiers and
  warning sounds.
- A **Synchronized Multiplayer Pause** — any player can pause; the pause menu
  opens for everyone with **Ready / Resume** and **View Map** buttons; a
  synchronized **countdown** plays before the game resumes. Disconnects, host
  migration and rejoin resyncs all pause the game automatically.
- A **"Waiting for Players" tooltip** — hovering the end-turn button while
  waiting shows exactly which players everyone is waiting on, one name per
  line, expanding upward so long lists never clip.

## Installation

1. Copy the mod folder into your mods folder:
   `…\Sid Meier's Civilization VII\Mods\Multiplayer-Toolkit\`
2. In game: **Main Menu → Additional Content** and enable **Multiplayer Toolkit**.
3. **Every player must install and enable the mod.** The pause state and the
   turn clock are synchronized by the engine, but the menus, tallies, countdown
   display and timer enforcement run per-client, so everyone needs it.

The mod is dormant in single-player.

## Competitive Turn Timer

### How to use

In the multiplayer game setup, set **Turn Timer** to **Competitive** (it sits
between None and Standard) and play with **Simultaneous** turns. Each turn is
then bounded by a clock computed for the active Age:

```
seconds = Base
        + PerCity  × (most cities any civ has)
        + PerUnit  × (most units any civ has)
        + PerHuman × (living human players)
        + PerTurn  × (current turn number)
```

City/unit counts use the largest empire, so every player gets the same number —
one shared, fair clock. Decimal weights (e.g. `PerTurn = 1.25`) are supported,
and the result rounds to the nearest whole second (`roundToNearest` in
`mp-timer-config.js`). When it reaches zero the turn ends automatically; a
player who un-readies after zero is re-ended within seconds.

### Urgency tiers

| Remaining | Display | Sound |
|---|---|---|
| above 30s | normal | engine's 60s warning only |
| 30s – 16s | **orange** | urgency beep at 30 / 25 / 20 |
| 15s – 0s | **steady red** | per-second countdown beeps |

### Tuning

| What | Where |
|---|---|
| Per-Age `Base` / `PerCity` / `PerUnit` | `data/timers/<age>/CompetitiveTimer.sql` |
| Default `PerHuman` / `PerTurn` (all Ages) | `data/timers/TimerScaling.sql` |
| Per-Age `PerHuman` / `PerTurn` overrides | `UPDATE MPT_TimerScaling …` in the Age's file (see antiquity) |
| Tier thresholds, colours, sounds, debug logging | `ui/mp-timer/mp-timer-config.js` |

### Implementation notes (honest)

- The engine only *enforces* its three built-in timer types; a data-registered
  fourth type is treated as unknown (fallback 180s display, no enforcement).
  The mod therefore proxies the action panel's `TurnTimerUpdated` listener and
  feeds the engine's own renderer the competitive time — so the native text,
  ring meter, flash and beeps all draw the real clock — and ends the local turn
  itself via `GameContext.sendTurnComplete()`.
- Remaining time derives from the engine's **synchronized phase clock**, so
  readying, un-readying and HUD interaction cannot desync or reset it. New
  turns are detected via `Game.turn`; backward clock corrections are tolerated;
  the display pins at zero once expired.
- A periodic guardian keeps the takeover in place if the action panel
  re-attaches, and the ring meter self-heals if a stray native render or
  ready-up reset desyncs it.
- Known cosmetic: the lobby **Rules** popup prints a debug string for the
  custom timer type (the base screen only knows the three built-ins). Age
  transitions use their own long phase and are passed through untouched.

## Synchronized Pause

- **Pause (any player):** open the pause menu (Esc) and click **Pause Game**.
  The game pauses for everyone and the pause menu opens on every player's screen.
- **While paused** every player sees the pause menu with:
  - **Resume (Host) / Ready** – the primary button (a working `fxs-button`; the
    native ui-next "Resume Game" hero button can't be hooked to actually unpause,
    so it is hidden while paused). A short hint sits **above** it ("You are the
    host. Resume when ready." for the host; a waiting note for others), and the
    live **"Ready: X / N"** tally sits in the **footer**, under the build number.
  - **View Map** – directly **below** the Resume button; returns you to the
    world so you can pan the map and open information / city & production panels.
    Press **Esc** to bring the pause menu back. You can look at anything; you
    just can't advance the game.
  - The **Pause Game** button (when not paused) sits **below** the menu's
    normal Resume button.
- **Resuming:** when the resume is triggered, every open pause menu is closed
  and a top-center **UNPAUSING…** overlay runs a **5-second countdown**. The game
  stays fully **paused during the countdown** (the mod re-asserts the pause flag
  for the duration), so no one can take a game-advancing action until the timer
  hits zero — only then does play actually resume, together.

### The unpause / "Ready" model

The engine keeps the game paused while **any** player holds a "want pause" flag,
and unpauses (synchronized) the instant all flags clear; a client can only clear
its **own** flag. The mod uses that primitive directly:

> flag held = "not ready", flag cleared = "ready". `Ready = N − wantPauseCount`,
> identical on every client, so the "Ready X/N" tally is synchronized for free.

Resume happens (last flag clears → engine unpauses) via, in order:

1. **Consensus** – everyone (the host included, whose flag is required) clicks
   Ready.
2. **Override** – after `hostOverrideDelayMs`, any readiness resumes the game
   (anti-AFK / host force-resume).

A third **60% vote** tier exists but is **disabled by default**
(`votingEnabled: false`); set it to `true` to re-enable auto-resume once
`voteThreshold` of players are ready after `voteDelayMs`. Because the host's
own flag is required for the consensus path, the host effectively gates a
normal resume. All values are configurable in `ui/mp-pause/mp-pause-config.js`.

**Engine limitation (honest note):** Civ VII exposes only an *aggregate*
want-pause count — there is no per-player or host-specific pause query and no
custom UI network message a mod can send. A *unilateral, instant* host-only
override that other clients could detect on the wire is therefore not possible
from a UI mod, so host authority is expressed through the configurable
thresholds above rather than as an instant force.

### Pause on disconnect (before AI takeover) — three layers

All three layers funnel into one `requestDisconnectPause()` path:

1. **Disconnect event** — `MultiplayerPostPlayerDisconnected` pauses immediately
   (reactive).
2. **Connection watchdog** — a timer polls `Network.isPlayerConnected(id)` for
   every human slot (every `connectionWatchMs`, default 0.5s) and pauses the
   instant a player's connection drops, even if the event is late or missed
   (proactive).
3. **Turn-activation guard** — on `PlayerTurnActivated` / `RemotePlayerTurnBegin`
   (the exact moment the engine would hand an absent player's turn to the AI),
   if any human is disconnected the game pauses first.

**Resume vs. re-pause.** The first drop always pauses before the AI. Once the
players *deliberately* resume with someone still absent, that player is
"acknowledged" so the guard does not fight the choice and the AI may take over.
If that player reconnects and later drops again, it is a fresh disconnect and
pauses again.

**Disconnect notices.** Each disconnected player gets their own bright-red line
in the pause menu ("Name#12345 disconnected."), using the platform gamertag
where available; a player's line clears when they rejoin.

**Host migration.** If the host drops or changes, the game pauses (if running),
"The host changed." is shown, and the menu controls rebuild so the new host
immediately gets the **Resume (Host)** button.

**Rejoin / resync.** When a player rejoins, the engine forces every client
through a resync. The mod pauses (if running) and opens the pause menu on every
screen for the duration, with "*Name* is reconnecting — resyncing."

*Honest scope:* the guarantee is as strong as a UI mod can make it — the
turn-activation guard fires at the start of turn processing, before AI orders
execute — but it is still event/poll-driven rather than a hook inside the
engine's AI loop.

### Blocked while paused

`next-action`, `keyboard-enter`, `force-end-turn`, `unit-move`,
`unit-ranged-attack`, `unit-skip-turn`, `unit-sleep`, `unit-fortify`,
`unit-heal`, `unit-alert`, `unit-auto-explore`, `trigger-accept-dip`,
`quick-load`. Camera, selection, information screens and city/production panels
are **not** blocked.

Each feature follows the same pattern: a `*-config.js` data module and a logic
module, mirroring the base game's UI conventions. See [`TESTING.md`](TESTING.md)

## Changelog

### 0.5.2

- **New: "Waiting for Players" tooltip** — hover the end-turn button to see who
  everyone is waiting on, one name per line, expanding upward.
- **Timer:** decimal scaling weights supported (e.g. `PerTurn = 1.25`); totals
  round to the nearest whole second (`roundToNearest`); the ring now freezes
  while the game is paused and resyncs on resume.
- **Pause:** the 60% vote-resume tier is disabled by default
  (`votingEnabled`); disconnect notices show each player's gamertag on its own
  bright-red line and clear on rejoin; host migration pauses the game and hands
  the new host the resume controls; a player rejoining pauses the game and
  opens the pause menu on every client during the resync.
- **Lobby:** the Competitive timer's setup description now explains the
  scaling, tiers and auto-end behaviour.
- **Dev:** FireTuner test guide (`TESTING.md`) and an in-game `MPTTimer` debug
  console API (status / forceRemaining / expire), active while `debug` is on.

### 0.5.1

- Competitive turn timer: per-Age scaling, orange/red urgency tiers with
  warning sounds, native ring/text rendering, automatic turn end.
- Code reorganization: config/logic module split for every feature.
